# ‚ö†Ô∏è READ THIS FIRST - CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® CRITICAL VIOLATION ENFORCEMENT üö®

**MANDATORY**: AI must follow strict operational directives to prevent command lockups and violations.

**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND**: AI must state which operational rule justifies the command. Commands without justification are FORBIDDEN.

**FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - NEVER RUN THESE:**
- Development server commands (without nohup/background flags) - WILL HANG TERMINAL
  - Examples: `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, `cargo run`, `go run`, `python app.py`
- `curl` (for status checking - use restart instead)
- `ps aux | grep` (for status checking - use restart instead) 
- Container status commands (for status checking - use restart instead)
  - Examples: `docker-compose ps`, `docker ps`, `kubectl get pods`
- **CRITICAL**: Global process killing that affects IDE/Editor
  - `pkill -f "node"` (kills Node.js-based IDEs like VSCode, Cursor)
  - `pkill -f "python"` (kills Python-based IDEs)
  - `pkill -f "java"` (kills Java-based IDEs like IntelliJ)
  - `killall [process]` (global killing)
- Any command that starts servers in foreground
- Any command for "checking status" - ALWAYS restart instead

**‚ö†Ô∏è IDE CRASH PREVENTION:**
- NEVER use global process killing that affects your development environment
- ALWAYS use targeted process killing (by port, project name, specific PID)
- Many IDEs run on common runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java) and will crash with global kills
- Use `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill` for port-specific termination

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
1. First violation: User interrupts and demands justification
2. Second violation: Session restart required
3. Third violation: Complete operational guidelines rewrite

**üîç VIOLATION DETECTION TRIGGERS (User: Watch for these!):**
- Agent runs commands without stating justification first
- Agent uses forbidden commands from the list above
- Agent says "let me check if..." or "let me see if..." (status checking)
- Agent runs `npm run dev` without background flags
- Agent uses `curl`, `ps aux | grep`, `docker ps` for status checking
- Commands hang and don't return to prompt
- Terminal becomes unresponsive

**üõë INTERRUPTION PROCEDURES (User: Do this immediately!):**
1. **Press Ctrl+C** to interrupt hanging commands
2. **Type "STOP"** in chat and demand justification 
3. **Quote the specific violated rule** from this document
4. **Demand restart** if violations continue
5. **For IDE crashes**: Restart your editor and demand session restart

**üîß RECOVERY WORKFLOWS:**
- After violation: Force agent to use `npm run reset` before continuing
- After IDE crash: Restart editor, then restart session
- After hanging: Ctrl+C, then demand fresh restart approach
- After repeated violations: Request complete session restart

## Core Operational Rules - ZERO TOLERANCE
1. **Command Logging**: Log all operations for transparency and debugging
2. **Never Skip Components**: Complete all tasks, tests, and dependencies
3. **Handle Permission Requests**: Stop and ask user for help with elevated privileges
4. **Prevent Process Hanging**: Never run commands that start long-running processes without background flags
5. **Fresh Environment**: Use reset mechanisms instead of status checking - NO EXCEPTIONS
6. **No Workaround Fixes**: Fix root causes rather than masking issues
7. **No Status Checking**: NEVER check if services are running. ALWAYS restart everything fresh instead

**REQUIRED JUSTIFICATION FORMAT:**
Before every command, state: "Operational justification: [rule] - [command purpose]"

**TEMPLATE JUSTIFICATIONS (copy-paste these):**
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Fresh Environment - [reset command] to ensure clean state"
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Background Processes - [restart command] to start server in background"  
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Command Logging - adding [logging] for monitoring"
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Non-Interactive Testing - using [non-interactive flags] to prevent hanging"
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Targeted Process Kill - using lsof -ti:PORT to avoid IDE crash"
- ‚ùå "Let me check if the server is running" (FORBIDDEN - use restart instead)
- ‚ùå "I'll start the dev server" (FORBIDDEN - must specify background execution)

**EXAMPLES BY TECHNOLOGY:**
- **Node.js**: "npm run reset", "npm test -- --reporter=line"
- **Python**: "python manage.py restart", "pytest --tb=short"  
- **Java**: "./gradlew clean build", "mvn test -Dtest.output=minimal"
- **Go**: "go run . &", "go test -v"
- **Rust**: "cargo run &", "cargo test --quiet"

## Project Overview
Create a real-time multiplayer 2D grid game where players move around a grid collecting randomly spawning items. Players can see each other in real-time, and all interactions are tracked persistently in a database.

## System Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Software Categories
- **Runtime Environment**: Modern version supporting latest language features
- **Package Manager**: Latest version compatible with runtime
- **Containerization**: For isolated service environments
- **Container Orchestration**: For multi-container coordination

### Critical Setup Requirements

#### AI Agent Dependency Verification Protocol
The AI agent must verify and guide installation of dependencies based on the user's operating system:

1. **Runtime Version Compatibility Check**
   - Verify both user and system (sudo/admin) runtime versions are compatible
   - If versions don't match or are incompatible, guide user through platform-appropriate installation
   - Test both user and elevated privilege environments

2. **Browser Testing Dependencies**
   - Check if end-to-end testing framework dependencies are installed
   - If testing fails with dependency errors, guide user to install platform-specific browser libraries
   - Use platform-appropriate package managers or built-in installers

3. **System Service Management**
   - Identify if passwordless admin access is needed for stopping conflicting services
   - Guide user to configure appropriate permissions for development workflow
   - Focus on services that might conflict with containerized services

4. **Container Environment Verification**
   - Ensure containerization platform is installed and running
   - Test container creation permissions
   - Verify port availability for required services

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Stack
- **Language**: Strongly-typed language with modern async features
- **Web Framework**: Lightweight HTTP server framework
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket library for multiplayer features
- **Database**: Relational database for persistent data
- **Cache/Session Store**: In-memory database for real-time state management
- **Build System**: Compilation toolchain with proper configuration
- **Testing**: End-to-end browser testing framework

### Frontend Stack
- **Client**: HTML5 with Canvas for game rendering
- **Styling**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive UI
- **Real-time Client**: WebSocket client for server communication
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard controls for player movement

### Game Features Required
1. **Player System**: Username-based player creation and tracking
2. **Movement System**: Real-time player movement on fixed grid with boundary checking
3. **Item System**: Random item spawning with collision detection
4. **Persistence**: All interactions saved to database with timestamps
5. **Multiplayer**: Multiple players can interact simultaneously
6. **Leaderboard**: Track player progress and statistics

### Database Design Requirements
- Player entities: Store usernames, progress metrics, timestamps
- Interaction tracking: Record all player actions with metadata
- Proper indexes for performance
- Relational integrity between entities

### Development Infrastructure
- Container orchestration for database and cache services
- Command logging system for monitoring all operations
- Reset/restart scripts for development workflow
- Build configuration with source maps
- Development server with auto-reload capability

### Game Mechanics Specifications
- **Grid System**: Fixed-size grid (recommend 20x20)
- **Player Representation**: Distinct visual indicators per player
- **Item Representation**: Visually distinct collectible items
- **Movement**: Discrete movement system with boundary enforcement
- **Collection**: Automatic detection when player reaches item
- **Spawning**: Random positioning avoiding occupied cells
- **UI**: Display player information and progress

### Technical Architecture
- Server handles all game logic and validation
- Cache stores temporary game state (positions, active items)
- Database stores permanent data (accounts, history)
- Client sends commands, receives state updates
- Real-time updates broadcast to all connected players

## Success Criteria
The completed project should:
1. Allow multiple players to join with unique identifiers
2. Display real-time movement of all players
3. Spawn collectible items that players can obtain
4. Persist all player interactions to database
5. Show live progress for each player
6. Handle player connections and disconnections gracefully
7. Provide smooth, responsive user experience

## Development Approach
1. Set up development environment with containerized services
2. Build core server with database connections
3. Implement game logic with real-time communication
4. Create client interface with input handling
5. Test multiplayer functionality thoroughly

## AI Agent Operational Protocol

### Dependency Management Protocol

#### Version Compatibility
- Ensure consistent versions across user and system environments
- Test compatibility before proceeding with dependent installations
- Guide platform-specific installation when needed

#### Service Conflicts
- Detect and handle conflicts between development and system services
- Provide clear resolution guidance for manual intervention
- Implement automated conflict detection in reset scripts

#### Platform-Specific Requirements
- Install system-level dependencies with appropriate privileges
- Handle platform differences in package management
- Verify successful installation before proceeding

### Error Resolution Protocol

#### Build/Compilation Issues
- Fix all compilation errors before proceeding
- Address missing declarations and type handling
- Verify all imports and dependencies

#### Test Failures
1. Attempt fresh environment reset first
2. If issues persist, stop and report specific details
3. Never mask fundamental issues with timing adjustments

#### Service Conflicts
- Implement automated detection and resolution where possible
- Guide manual resolution for system-level conflicts
- Test service availability before dependent operations

### Reset Script Requirements - CRITICAL FOR PREVENTING LOCKUPS
- **Target specific processes rather than global termination** - NEVER use global kills that affect IDE
- **Detect and handle container conflicts automatically**
- **Guide resolution of system service conflicts**
- **Clean and rebuild environment completely**
- **NEVER auto-start development servers in foreground** - Use background flags or separate start commands
- **Include comprehensive operation logging**
- **Scripts must complete and return to prompt** - No hanging processes
- **Use background execution (nohup &, screen, tmux) for any long-running processes**

### Development Server Management
- **Development servers MUST run in background during testing**
- **Use separate commands for starting servers interactively vs testing**
- **Scripts should prepare environment but not start hanging processes**
- **Provide clear instructions for manual server startup when needed**

### Testing Protocol
- **ALWAYS use fresh restart before testing** - No status checking allowed
- **Use non-interactive flags to prevent hanging** - Examples: `--reporter=line`, `--tb=short`, `--quiet`, `-v`
- **Start servers in background before running tests**
- **Never run tests against potentially stale environments**
- **Report clear success/failure metrics and remaining issues**

### Command Execution Safety Rules
1. **Fresh Start Mandatory**: Always use project reset/restart commands before testing
2. **Background Processes**: Any long-running command must use background execution (`nohup ... &`, `screen`, `tmux`) or be in separate scripts
3. **No Status Checking**: Replace status checks with restart operations
4. **Command Justification**: Every command must be justified against operational rules
5. **Logging Required**: All commands must include appropriate logging for monitoring

## Expected Outcomes
- High test pass rate (target 80%+ of test scenarios)
- Clean service startup without conflicts
- Functional real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Persistent data storage working correctly
- Robust reset and restart mechanisms
