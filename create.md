# Real-Time Multiplayer Grid Game - Project Creation Instructions

# ‚ö†Ô∏è READ THIS FIRST - CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® CRITICAL VIOLATION ENFORCEMENT üö®

**MANDATORY**: AI must follow strict operational directives to prevent command lockups and violations.

**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND**: AI must state which operational rule justifies the command. Commands without justification are FORBIDDEN.

**FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - NEVER RUN THESE:**
- Development server commands (without nohup/background flags) - WILL HANG TERMINAL
  - Examples: `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, `cargo run`, `go run`, `python app.py`
- `curl` (for status checking - use restart instead)
- `ps aux | grep` (for status checking - use restart instead) 
- Container status commands (for status checking - use restart instead)
  - Examples: `docker-compose ps`, `docker ps`, `kubectl get pods`
- **CRITICAL**: Global process killing that affects IDE/Editor
  - `pkill -f "node"` (kills Node.js-based IDEs like VSCode, Cursor)
  - `pkill -f "python"` (kills Python-based IDEs)
  - `pkill -f "java"` (kills Java-based IDEs like IntelliJ)
  - `killall [process]` (global killing)
- Any command that starts servers in foreground
- Any command for "checking status" - ALWAYS restart instead

**‚ö†Ô∏è IDE CRASH PREVENTION:**
- NEVER use global process killing that affects your development environment
- ALWAYS use targeted process killing (by port, project name, specific PID)
- Many IDEs run on common runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java) and will crash with global kills
- Use `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill` for port-specific termination

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
1. First violation: User interrupts and demands justification
2. Second violation: Session restart required
3. Third violation: Complete operational guidelines rewrite

**üîç VIOLATION DETECTION TRIGGERS (User: Watch for these!):**
- Agent runs commands without stating justification first
- Agent uses forbidden commands from the list above
- Agent says "let me check if..." or "let me see if..." (status checking)
- Agent runs `npm run dev` without background flags
- Agent uses `curl`, `ps aux | grep`, `docker ps` for status checking
- Commands hang and don't return to prompt
- Terminal becomes unresponsive

**üõë INTERRUPTION PROCEDURES (User: Do this immediately!):**
1. **Press Ctrl+C** to interrupt hanging commands
2. **Type "STOP"** in chat and demand justification 
3. **Quote the specific violated rule** from this document
4. **Demand restart** if violations continue
5. **For IDE crashes**: Restart your editor and demand session restart

**üîß RECOVERY WORKFLOWS:**
- After violation: Force agent to use `npm run reset` before continuing
- After IDE crash: Restart editor, then restart session
- After hanging: Ctrl+C, then demand fresh restart approach
- After repeated violations: Request complete session restart

## Core Operational Rules - ZERO TOLERANCE
1. **Command Logging**: Log all operations for transparency and debugging
2. **Never Skip Components**: Complete all tasks, tests, and dependencies
3. **Handle Permission Requests**: Stop and ask user for help with elevated privileges
4. **Prevent Process Hanging**: Never run commands that start long-running processes without background flags
5. **Fresh Environment**: Use reset mechanisms instead of status checking - NO EXCEPTIONS
6. **No Workaround Fixes**: Fix root causes rather than masking issues
7. **No Status Checking**: NEVER check if services are running. ALWAYS restart everything fresh instead

**REQUIRED JUSTIFICATION FORMAT:**
Before every command, state: "Operational justification: [rule] - [command purpose]"

**TEMPLATE JUSTIFICATIONS (copy-paste these):**
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Fresh Environment - [reset command] to ensure clean state"
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Background Processes - [restart command] to start server in background"  
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Command Logging - adding [logging] for monitoring"
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Non-Interactive Testing - using [non-interactive flags] to prevent hanging"
- ‚úÖ "Operational justification: Targeted Process Kill - using lsof -ti:PORT to avoid IDE crash"
- ‚ùå "Let me check if the server is running" (FORBIDDEN - use restart instead)
- ‚ùå "I'll start the dev server" (FORBIDDEN - must specify background execution)

**EXAMPLES BY TECHNOLOGY:**
- **Node.js**: "npm run reset", "npm test -- --reporter=line"
- **Python**: "python manage.py restart", "pytest --tb=short"  
- **Java**: "./gradlew clean build", "mvn test -Dtest.output=minimal"
- **Go**: "go run . &", "go test -v"
- **Rust**: "cargo run &", "cargo test --quiet"

## Project Overview
Create a real-time multiplayer 2D grid game where players move around a grid collecting randomly spawning items. Players can see each other in real-time, and all interactions are tracked persistently in a database.

## System Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Software Categories
- **Runtime Environment**: Modern version supporting latest language features
- **Package Manager**: Latest version compatible with runtime
- **Containerization**: For isolated service environments
- **Container Orchestration**: For multi-container coordination

### Critical Setup Requirements

#### AI Agent Dependency Verification Protocol
The AI agent must verify and guide installation of dependencies based on the user's operating system:

1. **Runtime Version Compatibility Check**
   - Verify both user and system (sudo/admin) runtime versions are compatible
   - If versions don't match or are incompatible, guide user through platform-appropriate installation
   - Test both user and elevated privilege environments

2. **Browser Testing Dependencies**
   - Check if end-to-end testing framework dependencies are installed
   - If testing fails with dependency errors, guide user to install platform-specific browser libraries
   - Use platform-appropriate package managers or built-in installers

3. **System Service Management**
   - Identify if passwordless admin access is needed for stopping conflicting services
   - Guide user to configure appropriate permissions for development workflow
   - Focus on services that might conflict with containerized services

4. **Container Environment Verification**
   - Ensure containerization platform is installed and running
   - Test container creation permissions
   - Verify port availability for required services

```

### üö® MANDATORY SECOND STEP - SCREENSHOT TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE üö®

**BEFORE ANY GAME DEVELOPMENT**: AI must set up screenshot testing infrastructure.

**SCREENSHOT INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Create screenshots directory** for test visual validation
2. **Configure test framework** to capture screenshots automatically
3. **Set up .gitignore** to ignore screenshots but preserve directory structure
4. **Add screenshot capture to test setup** for both failures and successes
5. **Configure visual regression testing** for core UI components

**MANDATORY SCREENSHOT SETUP CHECKLIST:**
- ‚úÖ Create `screenshots/` directory in project root
- ‚úÖ Configure test framework to save screenshots
- ‚úÖ Add screenshots to .gitignore with directory preservation
- ‚úÖ Set up automatic screenshot capture on test failures
- ‚úÖ Configure success screenshots for critical game mechanics

**FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC SETUP:**
- **Playwright**: Configure in `playwright.config.ts` with screenshot options
- **Cypress**: Add screenshot commands to test setup  
- **Selenium**: Configure screenshot capture in test framework setup

**SCREENSHOT IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES:**
- **Playwright**: `await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/test-name.png' })`
- **Cypress**: `cy.screenshot('test-name')`
- **Selenium**: `driver.save_screenshot('screenshots/test-name.png')`

**EXAMPLE .GITIGNORE ENTRY:**
```
# Screenshots directory structure preserved, but files ignored
screenshots/
!screenshots/.gitkeep
```

### Dependency Management Protocol

#### Version Compatibility
- Ensure consistent versions across user and system environments
- Test compatibility before proceeding with dependent installations
- Guide platform-specific installation when needed

#### Service Conflicts
- Detect and handle conflicts between development and system services
- Provide clear resolution guidance for manual intervention
- Implement automated conflict detection in reset scripts

#### Platform-Specific Requirements
- Install system-level dependencies with appropriate privileges
- Handle platform differences in package management
- Verify successful installation before proceeding

### Error Resolution Protocol

#### Build/Compilation Issues
- Fix all compilation errors before proceeding
- Address missing declarations and type handling
- Verify all imports and dependencies

#### Test Failures
1. Attempt fresh environment reset first
2. If issues persist, stop and report specific details
3. Never mask fundamental issues with timing adjustments

#### Service Conflicts
- Implement automated detection and resolution where possible
- Guide manual resolution for system-level conflicts
- Test service availability before dependent operations

### Reset Script Requirements - CRITICAL FOR PREVENTING LOCKUPS
- **Target specific processes rather than global termination** - NEVER use global kills that affect IDE
- **Detect and handle container conflicts automatically**
- **Guide resolution of system service conflicts**
- **Clean and rebuild environment completely**
- **NEVER auto-start development servers in foreground** - Use background flags or separate start commands
- **Include comprehensive operation logging**
- **Scripts must complete and return to prompt** - No hanging processes
- **Use background execution (nohup &, screen, tmux) for any long-running processes**

### Single Command Operation Requirements - MANDATORY
**MUST CREATE**: One command that performs complete teardown and rebuild of entire environment.

**SINGLE COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS:**
- **Command name**: `npm run reset` (Node.js) or equivalent for chosen stack
- **Complete teardown**: Kill all processes, remove containers, clean volumes, clear logs
- **Environment rebuild**: Restart services, initialize databases, build code
- **Dependency check**: Verify all services are healthy before completion
- **Background execution**: Start servers in background, never hang terminal
- **Comprehensive logging**: Log every step for debugging
- **Return to prompt**: Command must complete and return control

**IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES:**
- **Node.js**: `npm run reset` calls script that does full teardown/rebuild
- **Python**: `python manage.py reset_all` for Django projects
- **Java**: `./gradlew resetEnvironment` for Gradle projects
- **Go**: `make reset` using Makefile
- **Rust**: `cargo run --bin reset` for custom reset binary

**SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Stop all project processes (targeted, not global)
2. Stop and remove all containers/services
3. Clean volumes and temporary data
4. Restart infrastructure services
5. Wait for services to be healthy
6. Initialize/migrate databases
7. Build application code
8. Start application in background
9. Verify everything is working
10. Return to prompt with status message

### Development Server Management
- **Development servers MUST run in background during testing**
- **Use separate commands for starting servers interactively vs testing**
- **Scripts should prepare environment but not start hanging processes**
- **Provide clear instructions for manual server startup when needed**

### Testing Protocol - MANDATORY EXECUTION
- **ALWAYS use fresh restart before testing** - No status checking allowed
- **Use non-interactive flags to prevent hanging** - Examples: `--reporter=line`, `--tb=short`, `--quiet`, `-v`
- **Start servers in background before running tests**
- **Never run tests against potentially stale environments**
- **Report clear success/failure metrics and remaining issues**

### Incremental Testing Requirements - AFTER EACH MAJOR FEATURE
**MANDATORY**: Agent must test each major feature immediately after implementation.

**INCREMENTAL TESTING PROTOCOL:**
1. **After database/server setup**: Test basic connectivity and health endpoints
2. **After WebSocket implementation**: Test real-time communication and game state updates
3. **After UI creation**: Test basic rendering, controls, and user interactions
4. **After player system**: Test player creation, movement, position tracking
5. **After item/money system**: Test item spawning, visibility, collection detection
6. **After multiplayer features**: Test real-time synchronization between multiple clients

**FEATURE-SPECIFIC TEST REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Database connectivity**: Connection success, table creation, basic queries
- **WebSocket communication**: Connect, disconnect, message sending/receiving
- **UI rendering**: Canvas display, player visualization, UI controls
- **Player movement**: Arrow key controls, boundary checking, position updates
- **Money/item system**: Spawning mechanics, visual display, collection detection
- **Multiplayer sync**: Multiple players visible, real-time position updates

**IF FEATURE TESTS FAIL:**
1. **STOP development** - do not proceed to next feature
2. **Run fresh environment reset** - use npm run reset
3. **Investigate and fix** the specific feature issue
4. **Re-test the feature** until it passes
5. **Only then proceed** to the next feature implementation

**üö® ANTI-PATTERN PREVENTION:**
- **NEVER** implement multiple features without testing each one
- **NEVER** create workaround implementations (SQLite instead of PostgreSQL)
- **NEVER** debug infrastructure for more than 15 minutes without reset
- **NEVER** ignore feature testing requirements
- **ALWAYS** test database connectivity before building game logic
- **ALWAYS** test WebSocket connections before building client
- **ALWAYS** test UI rendering before implementing game mechanics

### Final Test Execution Requirements - ZERO TOLERANCE
**MANDATORY**: Agent must run comprehensive final test suite after all features are implemented and tested.

**FINAL TEST EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**
1. **Fresh environment restart** before running any tests
2. **Run complete integrated test suite** using non-interactive flags (includes screenshot testing)
3. **Verify test results** - minimum 80% pass rate required
4. **Fix all failing tests** before considering project complete

**FINAL TESTING SCOPE:**
- Integration testing of all features working together
- Full user workflow testing (join ‚Üí move ‚Üí collect ‚Üí leaderboard)
- Multi-player scenario testing with screenshot evidence
- Database persistence verification across sessions
- Performance and stability testing

**CORE MECHANICS TESTING CHECKLIST (verified by automated tests with screenshots):**
- ‚úÖ Player can join game with username
- ‚úÖ Player movement works in all directions
- ‚úÖ **Money/items spawn and are visible** (screenshot evidence)
- ‚úÖ **Money/items can be collected by walking onto them** (screenshot evidence)
- ‚úÖ **Player money total updates when collecting items** (screenshot evidence)
- ‚úÖ Multiple players can join simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates work between players
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard displays and updates
- ‚úÖ Database persistence works

**FAILURE SCENARIOS THAT MUST BE CAUGHT:**
- Money acts as obstacles instead of collectibles
- Collection detection not working
- Real-time updates not syncing between players
- Database not persisting player progress
- Tests passing but game mechanics broken

**IF TESTS FAIL:**
1. Do NOT consider project complete
2. Investigate and fix root cause
3. Re-run full test suite (including screenshot validation)
4. Only complete when all tests pass with screenshot evidence


### Command Execution Safety Rules
1. **Fresh Start Mandatory**: Always use project reset/restart commands before testing
2. **Background Processes**: Any long-running command must use background execution (`nohup ... &`, `screen`, `tmux`) or be in separate scripts
3. **No Status Checking**: Replace status checks with restart operations
4. **Command Justification**: Every command must be justified against operational rules using CLAUDE.md
5. **Logging Required**: All commands must include appropriate logging for monitoring
6. **CLAUDE.md Reference**: Agent must reference CLAUDE.md before every command execution
7. **Screenshot Documentation**: Tests must capture screenshots for debugging and validation
8. **Incremental Testing Mandatory**: Agent must test each major feature immediately after implementation
9. **Final Test Execution Mandatory**: Agent must run comprehensive final test suite before considering project complete
